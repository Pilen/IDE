      This is a visualisation of a set of hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each hand is described as a 112 dimensional vector, with 56 x coordinates and 56 y coordinates.
      When paired up, each coordinate represents a part of the line drawing a 2d representation of the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The color is used to more easily find specific hands from the dataset, but has no inherent meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">Principal Component Analysys (PCA)</a> is a technique for finding the axes in the dimensions of the data based on the variance.
      The first component, is the highest variance, the second component the second highest variance and so on.
      In many datasets a lot of difference is encoded in the couple of dimensions of the PCA, while the lower dimensions are indistinguishable from noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the hands, the PCA has been calculated and plotted in the system.
      On the x-axis the first component is plotted, and on the y-axis the second component.
      Hover over a component to see the corresponding hand shape.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this dataset it can be seen how hands to the left in the plot are very open, and hands to the right are closed.
      The y axis seems to tell something about how the middle and ring finger are positioned.
