      Here we take a look on the temperature development in Copenhagen in the period 1880-2015.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the top plot, the meassured temperature is ploted for each month (hover the cursor above a label to isolate it). An average of the temperature for the year is plotted as green.
      In the bottom plot a heatmap is shown, with months on the x axis (jan. to dec.)
      and years plotted starting with 1880 in the top and 2015 at the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall the temperatures are "fairly" stable, a slight increase in the average temperature can be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is more obvious is the fluctuations in temperature in the winter months.
      For some years the winters are "blue", while other are yellow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall it seems that the yellow mid temperatures are extending, making the winters shorter. At the same time more bright red spots show up during the summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does look like the average temperature is rising slowly in Copenhagen.
    </p>

    <p>
      To get a better image of temperature development it would be usefull to have comparable data for other locations. The average temperature per month in Denmark, Europe and the world could be beneficial.
      Comparing the data for other locations it would be easier to see if variations are due to a bigger phenomena.
