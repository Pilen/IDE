        This is a visualization of the pdb2rh1 molecule.
      </p>
      <p>
        The structure is based on pdb2rh1.ent describing the molecule.
        <pre>
          awk 'BEGIN {OFS=", "; print "var pdb2rh1_molecule = ["} /^ATOM/ {print "    { x: "substr($0, 32, 7),"y: "substr($0, 40, 7), "z: "substr($0, 48, 7), "element: \""substr($0, 78,1)"\" },"} END {print "];"}' pdb2rh1.ent > pdb2rh1.js
        </pre>
        All atoms has been extracted by a simple awk command, and turned into a simple js list of atoms.
      </p>
      <p>
        The atoms are color coded by element, C=gray, N=blue, O=red, S=yellow, H=white. All atoms with an euclidian distance of less than 1.9 has a bond drawn as a simple line.
      </p>
      <p>
        The view is controlled by the mouse, Left click to rotate, middle click to zoom, right click to pan.<br/>
        These controls are taken from the orbital controls example from three.js.<br/>
        A black dot is drawn to indicate the pivot of the camera.
      </p>
      <p>
        To accentuate details a simple lighting system has been put in place with light source at the camera and at the pivot to highlight the areas being looked at.
