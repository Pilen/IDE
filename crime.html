        In the above visualization 10000 crimescenes in San Francisco are plotted on a map.
      </p>
      <p>
        The map is divided into the 10 police districts of the city.
        The color of the district is based on the crimerate (number of incidents in the district), black being the district with most crime and white for districts with no crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each incident is plotted as a point with a simple colorcode, hover over the legends to filter out the different categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is immediately obvious that most of San Francisco's crime is centered around the tenderloin district.
        But a strip down the middle of the mission district is also ladden with crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems drug/narcotics crimes are a good indicator of the general crimelevel in the area. It clusters around the centers of the of the other types of crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        The economic crimes (blue) and thivery (green) especially burglary and vehicle theft are more spread out.
        Though there are still a lot of these in the area around the tenderloin, they seem to be occur in the entire city.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are severeal spots in the map with no/very little crime occuring.
        The most dominant spots are The golden gate park, Mount Sutro/Twin Peaks/diamond heights and Lake Merced Park. But if you compare the visualization with a map you will see that most parks and open areas have little or no crime.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that walking home at night in a dark park might feel scary and uncomfortable, but it might actually be safer than going through the city.
        Tvshows love the suspense of a innocent woman being stalked and assulted with no one around to help, but reality is that not much is going on in these places.
