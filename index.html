    We use github-pages for the server. Its a simple setup linking a github repo to a static page.
    The only downside is that the page is static/no serverside processing is enabled.
    The bandwidth and disk quota is not strictly specified, but for smaller sites (which the service is intended) the ease of use and stability is fine.

    Circular bundling is used for showing inter connections between elements in a set.
    The diagram can give an overview of the tendencies while yielding details interactivle when hovering the cursor over a label on the circel.
    The downside is that the circular layout of the labels have little meaning and the connections can become too cluttered for any meaning to be seen.

    Graphs let you explore connections between items.
    Huge graphs can easily become so convoluted that they grant little overview, or the edges become too cluttered to get a sense of what is connected.

    Bubbles let you quickly distinguish the major parts of a diagram.
    Finding the smaller bubbles can be hard, also it can be tricky to estimate the exact difference, only that one thing is bigger than another.

    A tree structure can be a nice structure for hieracal data, an example is visualizing the DOM in a webbrowser for webdevelopment, or in a filebrowser.
    The visualization falls slightly apart when many items are nested on the same level, turning the tree more or less into a listing.

    SÃ¸ren would like to be able to build a searchable graph at the end of the course.
    An example would be the graph containing all webpages visited in a browser. connected by how they were visited (resulting in a tree structure). But also connected by their subject/content.
    This graph could be as the main way of interacting with the browser, in an attempt to replace bookmarks and the history and multiple open tabs.
    Instead of searching a list (or tree) of bookmarks with manual written names and tags you could search the entire graph, more important pages could be ranked higher.
    When searching for a previously opened page instead of having to remember the exact page name, the context of how it was found last can be used to relocate it in the graph.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    The data could be collected by a browser/plugin, both tracking how pages are visited from each other, by automatically extracting keywords about content and by manual ranking of "interesting" pages.
